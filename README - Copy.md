I should get (20) out of 20 on this assignment.

I lost all my commits when I had to create a new repository to allow for hosting my page

## Self-Reflection:

It took a little longer than I expected. I spent a lot of time trying to rename the repository but couldnt find a way. After a few commits I understood the process of adding and pushing my work to the repository much better. Working with git should be a much smoother process on the next assignment.

### How long it took me to finish this?

## 9 hours including the time to find the right photo and makes necessary the necessary changes.

I came across some issues when coming back to complete the assignment.
#1 npm test came back with two errors after not having any the day before
#2 I had to delete the original repository add create a new one to be able to host the page
#3 I have been repeating getting messages about the failure of Github classroom work flow failure
